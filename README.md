# Elemental-Excess-RIS-Code
This repository compiles code that can be used to calculate an elemental excess (atoms/nm<sup>2</sup>) from one dimensional composition profiles displaying elemental segregation. This code was primarily written in order to quantify radiation-induced segregation in proton-irradiated 316L stainless steel.

The key result from this code is the text file: "ELEMENTALEXCESSMinMaxData.txt" which reports the elemental excess for the segregation of a specific element in a line scan and the width of the integration profile utilized to calculate it. 

In this repository, you will find the core python code, which compiles all of the necessary functions utilized in the elemental excess algorithm. You will also find scripts for 4 different use cases: 
(1) A single line scan of a single element
(2) A single line scan with multiple elements
(3) Multiple line scans with a single element
(4) Multiple line scans with multiple elements
