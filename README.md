# Elemental-Excess-RIS-Code
This repository compiles code that can be used to calculate an elemental excess (atoms/nm<sup>2</sup>) from on one dimensional composition profiles displaying segregation. This code was primarily written in order to quantify radiation-induced segregation in proton-irradiated 316L. You are required to cite the following paper when using this code: S. K. Wonner and P. Bellon, "Investigation of radiation-induced segregation at fully characterized coherent twin boundaries in proton-irradiated 316L stainless steel," Journal of Nuclear Materials, vol. 604, p. 155470, 2025/01/01/ 2025, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnucmat.2024.155470.
