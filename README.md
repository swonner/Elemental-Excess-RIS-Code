# Elemental-Excess-RIS-Code
This repository compiles code that can be used to calculate an elemental excess (atoms/nm<sup>2</sup>) from one dimensional composition profiles displaying elemental segregation. This code was primarily written in order to quantify radiation-induced segregation in proton-irradiated 316L.
